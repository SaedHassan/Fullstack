//q1 - Write a conditional statement to state if hero is a dc character or marvel character. (i.e superman would be dc, spiderman would be marvel).

var hero = "superman"

if(hero.toLocaleLowerCase() === "superman" hero.toLocaleLowerCase() === "batman"){
    console.log(`${hero} is a dc character`)
}else{if (hero.toLocaleLowerCase() === "spiderman" || hero.toLocaleLowerCase( === "hulk"){

    console.log(`$(hero) is a marvel character`)
}


//q2 - write a conditional statement taking age as variable and what year group they will be in a school (i.e 11-16 will be secondary school year group, 16-18 college anyone above optional education).

var age = 11

if (age >= 11 || age<=16){
    console.log("Your year group will be in secondary school")

}

//q3 - Create a shopping list of 5 items. Now make a conditional statement that checks if the list contains 5 items only. if above 5 print out error and if less than 5 print out error.**

var list = [1,2,3,4,5]

console.log(list.length === 5){
    
}



//q4 - Write a conditional statement that takes into consideration validations (i.e case sensitivity). this will be entire up to you as to what the conditional statement is on.


//q5 - Create a conditional statement for the below flowchart.
